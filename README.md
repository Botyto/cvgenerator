# cvgenerator

Write your own .py file in the input directory, choose a template and run generator.py --profile=your-py-filename --template=your-template-name

You'll get an HTML and PDF file of your CV in the output folder. Watch the console output for criticism on your CV. 

Use the option --continuous to get real time updates on your HTML file, as you edit your profile or the template itself.
